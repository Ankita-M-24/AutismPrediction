# AutismPrediction
This project uses machine learning to predict autism risk based on behavioral and demographic data. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics. Future improvements include deep learning integration and dataset expansion.
